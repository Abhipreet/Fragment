        Mountain biking is becoming a popular sport. For the last six years,
        MTB Himachal has been organized regularly by HASTPA, an NGO.
         It is attended by a number of national and international participants,
          such as Indian Army, Indian Air Force, ITBP and a number of young and
           energetic MTB individual riders from cities like Pune, Bangalore, Delhi
            and Chandigarh. Last year, the government of Sikkim (Department of Tourism)
            introduced its own MTB race with South East Asia's biggest prize money.
            The second edition saw 48 professional participants from across the globe.

        The Tour of Nilgiris is a major non-competitive
        & non-commercial touring event in South Asia that covers
        1,000 kilometres in under 10 days.[1] The Tour of Nilgiris (TfN), Indiaâ€™s
        first Day Touring Cycle Ride, was born in the December of 2008 with the twin objectives
        of promoting bicycling as an activity and spreading awareness about the bio-diversity,
        flora and fauna of the Nilgiris.
