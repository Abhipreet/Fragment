I  would say that, of course. I’m  a novelist – I’ve written five books for teenagers – and it’s obviously in my interest to encourage people to read.
But there’s increasing evidence that reading for pleasure isn’t just another leisure pursuit, or merely a  way of improving literacy skills and factual knowledge.
It might actually be good for our mental and physical health too.

      <h2>Why should people read online </h2>
        <p>Learning makes everyone distinguish from others. Online reading makes you easy for reading anything at time.eading is good for you. I  would say that, of course. I’m  a novelist – I’ve written five books for teenagers – and it’s obviously in my interest to encourage people to read.

It might actually be good for our mental and physical health too.
In an age of Twitter and  short attention spans, reading novels – which requires intense concentration over a long period of time – could be the antidote.
Neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield says that reading helps to lengthen attention spans in children and improves their ability to think clearly.
‘Stories have a beginning, a middle and an end – a structure that  encourages our brains to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance,’  she says.
‘It is essential to learn this skill as a small child, while the brain has more plasticity, which is why it’s so important for parents to read to their children.
‘The more we do it, the better we get at it.’
